## FXHASH Requirements
Based on research, here are the key FXHASH requirements for deterministic generative art:

1. **Deterministic Output**: The artwork must generate the same output when provided with the same seed.

2. **fxrand() Function**: Use the fxrand() function instead of Math.random() to ensure deterministic randomness.
   - Generates a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1
   - When run locally, behaves similarly to Math.random()
   - Must be used for all randomization in the project

3. **Project Structure**:
   - index.html (main entry point)
   - sketch.js (main generative art logic)
   - style.css (styling and responsiveness)
   - fxhash-snippet.js (FXHASH integration code)

4. **HTML Requirements**:
   - The index.html file must include specific code in the head section
   - The FXHASH platform injects code when tokens are generated
   - Two key variables are exposed by the FXHASH host:
     - `fxhash`: A unique hash for deterministic generation
     - `fxrand()`: A deterministic random number generator

5. **Responsive Design**: The artwork should adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

6. **Unique Outputs**: The algorithm should produce varied and unique outputs based on different seeds.

7. **Code-Based Generation**: The artwork should be generated through code rather than pre-rendered assets.

## Recommendations for Implementation
1. Use the official FXHASH boilerplate as a starting point: https://github.com/fxhash/fxhash-boilerplate

2. Replace all random functions with fxrand() to ensure deterministic outputs.

3. Create an infinite, glitchy generative art piece using the patterns and symbols extracted from toxiExample.txt.

4. Ensure the artwork is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

5. Design the algorithm to support at least 500,000 unique variations.

6. Implement movement and varied colors without flashing.

7. Test the project thoroughly to ensure it meets all FXHASH requirements.
