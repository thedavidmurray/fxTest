# Glitchy Code Art - FXHASH Generative Art Project

## Project Concept

This generative art project creates an infinite, glitchy visual experience inspired by code patterns found in the toxiExample.txt file. The artwork generates unique visual compositions using symbols, patterns, and structures extracted from programming syntax, creating an ever-evolving digital landscape that explores the aesthetic qualities of code as a visual medium.

The project transforms technical elements into an artistic expression, highlighting the beauty in the structured chaos of programming languages. Each token generates a unique variation with different patterns, colors, movements, and special features.

## Viewing Instructions

1. Open the project in a modern web browser
2. The artwork will automatically begin its infinite animation
3. Each refresh or new token will generate a completely different variation
4. The artwork is responsive and will adapt to any screen size or device

## Technical Details

### Implementation

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The project is built using vanilla web technologies
- **Canvas API**: All visual elements are rendered using the HTML5 Canvas API
- **FXHASH Integration**: Uses the FXHASH snippet for deterministic randomness
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to any screen size
- **Infinite Animation**: Creates continuous, ever-evolving visuals

### Features

- **Pattern Types**: Matrix, Grid, Flow, Particles, Symbols
- **Color Schemes**: Monochrome, Complementary, Analogous, Triadic, Custom
- **Movement Styles**: Wave, Pulse, Jitter, Flow, Orbit
- **Special Features**: Infinity Symbol, Code Fragments, Matrix Effect, Particle System
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple, Moderate, Complex, Intricate

### Unique Variations

The project supports over 500,000 unique variations through combinations of:
- 5 pattern types
- 5 color schemes
- Continuous density values
- 5 movement styles
- Continuous complexity values
- 5 special features
- Various color combinations

## Development Process

This project was developed by analyzing patterns in the toxiExample.txt file, extracting meaningful symbols and structures, and transforming them into visual elements. The symbols were categorized and used to create a generative system that produces infinite, non-repeating visual compositions.
